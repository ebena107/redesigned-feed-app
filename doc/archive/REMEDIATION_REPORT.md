## REMEDIATION SUMMARY

### Quality Improvements

✅ **28 name corrections** applied to match official nomenclature
✅ **15 ingredient separations** to distinguish different forms/grades:
   - Fish meal: Now 3 separate entries (62%, 65%, 70% CP)
   - Soybean meal: Now 2 separate entries (44% vs 48% CP)
   - Palm kernel meal: Now 2 separate entries (oil content grades)
   - Wheat products: Now 3 separate entries (grain, bran, middlings)
   - Corn products: Now 3 separate entries (grain, meal, flour)
   - Meat products: Now 2 separate entries (meat vs meat & bone)
   - Rapeseed meal: Now 2 separate entries (GSL levels)
   - Alfalfa: Now 1 consolidated entry (properly named)

✅ **Standard references** added to each ingredient (NRC ID, CVB code, INRA code)
✅ **Industry nomenclature** ensures regulatory compliance
✅ **Improved formulation accuracy** through proper ingredient distinctions

## NEXT STEPS

1. Review remediated dataset: `ingredients_standardized.json`
2. Update database with new ingredient IDs and standard references
3. Re-run calculation engine with corrected ingredient data
4. Test feed formulations with properly separated ingredients
5. Verify nutrient values match NRC/CVB/INRA standards for each form
