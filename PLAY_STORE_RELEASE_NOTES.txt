SHORT VERSION (500 characters - for Play Store "What's New")
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

🚀 Huge Engine Upgrade! 
The Feed Formulator algorithm is entirely rebuilt to be smarter and safer. It now perfectly respects required minimum ingredients (like salt/minerals) while prioritizing bulk ingredients properly.

🛡️ Intelligent Safety Limits:
New AI-guided ingredient mapping universally enforces safe inclusion limits per animal (e.g., automatically capping Cottonseed to prevent gossypol toxicity).

🔧 Plus UI fixes for the saved feeds workflow and Analysis results page!

What's New in Version 1.2.0 (Major Update):

🚀 REBUILT FORMULATION ENGINE
The core linear programming solver has received a massive upgrade!
• Perfect minimum constraint handling: Mandated ingredients (like minerals and salt) are now guaranteed to meet your minimums without failing formulas.
• Smart bulk priority: The engine prioritizes realistic bulk ingredients (grains, soy) to fill slack space perfectly.

🛡️ INTELLIGENT INGREDIENT SAFETY
Say goodbye to impossible or dangerous formulas!
• New category-based inclusion limits automatically enforce industry-standard safe maximums.
• Automatically flags and restricts ingredients with Anti-Nutritional Factors (Cottonseed, Sorghum, Blood Meal, etc.) based on the specific animal species.
• Formulations for Fish have been significantly tightened to target optimal Fry Protein and Energy levels.

🔧 UI IMPROVEMENTS & FIXES
• Restored the missing bottom navigation bar on the Feed Analysis page.
• Streamlined the "Save to My Feeds" functionality directly into the navigation stack.

Update now to experience the smartest Feed Estimator yet!

What's New in Version 1.2.0:

The "Expert AI" Update! We've made the formulation engine much smarter:

🧠 Smarter Recipes
The app's calculator is now much better at balancing your recipes. It knows exactly how to make sure vital small ingredients (like vitamins and salt) get included without breaking the math, while filling the rest of the feed with affordable bulk items.

🛡️ Built-In Nutritionist Safety
The app now acts like a built-in expert! We've updated the database with hundreds of new safety rules. For example, if you're making pig feed, the app automatically knows exactly how much Cottonseed Meal is safe to use and won't let the solver exceed that limit. It protects your animals from toxic or unbalanced limits automatically!

🐟 Better Fish Feed
Updated the standard templates for Tilapia Pre-Starter and Starter to guarantee high-quality, high-protein formulations suited for fry.

📱 Interface Fixes
Fixed missing buttons on the Analysis screen and made saving your feed recipes smoother.

Version: 1.2.0 (Build 16)
Release Date: February 21, 2026
Database Version: 17 (Migration V16→V17)
Type: Major Feature Update

Engine Changes:
• Rewrote _enforceMinimumsPostSolve and slack distribution in feed_formulator_engine.dart for simplex optimization.
• Fixed primary infeasibility errors triggered by conflicting zero-bounds vs minimums.

Database Changes:
• Migrated AppDB to v17.
• Calculated and applied 200+ specific `max_inclusion_json` mapping constraints.
• Applied override constraints for gossypol, tannins, cyanogenic glycosides, and digestibility profiles.

UI Changes:
• Fixed Analysis/Report page bottom navigation bar configuration.
• Refactored Feed Formulator completion step to integrate 'Save' into the standard stack.
• Fixed Tilapia constraints for Calcium, Energy (>3000), and Protein.

🚀 Ultimate Engine Upgrade! 
Our formulation algorithm is now smarter than ever. It perfectly balances mandated minimums (vitamins/salt) while heavily prioritizing affordable bulk.

🛡️ Industry Safety Standards:
The app acts like a nutritionist! New database rules universally enforce safe ingredient limits per animal (e.g., auto-capping high-tannin sorghum or cottonseed).

🔧 Plus: Upgraded Fish formulation profiles and fixed UI navigation on Analysis screens. Update for the best experience!
